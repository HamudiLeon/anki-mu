Question	OptionA	OptionB	OptionC	OptionD	OptionE	Correct	Explanation
If a researcher is studying the internal structure of a mitochondria at the highest possible magnification, which method is required?	Light microscopy with H&E staining	Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface topography	Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for ultrastructure	Phase-contrast microscopy	Confocal laser microscopy	C	<b>Correct answer:</b> C — Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)<br><br><b>Core idea (exam focus)</b><br>TEM provides the highest resolution for intracellular ultrastructure.<br><br><b>Mechanism / reasoning</b><br>Electrons pass through ultrathin sections, allowing visualization of mitochondrial cristae and membranes.
A patient presents with Turner Syndrome. Based on cytogenetic classification, this condition is a:	Structural chromosomal abnormality	Numerical chromosomal abnormality	Single-gene mutation	Multifactorial disorder	Epigenetic modification	B	<b>Correct answer:</b> B — Numerical chromosomal abnormality<br><br><b>Core idea (exam focus)</b><br>Turner syndrome is caused by monosomy X (45,X).<br><br><b>Mechanism / reasoning</b><br>The total chromosome number is altered, not the structure.
Which histological technique is used to localize a specific protein using labeled antibodies?	Autoradiography	Histochemistry	Immunohistochemistry	In situ hybridization	Electron microscopy	C	<b>Correct answer:</b> C — Immunohistochemistry<br><br><b>Core idea (exam focus)</b><br>Antibody–antigen specificity allows protein localization.<br><br><b>Mechanism / reasoning</b><br>Labeled antibodies bind selectively to target proteins in tissue sections.
A limb defect caused by an amniotic band during pregnancy is classified as a:	Malformation	Deformation	Disruption	Sequence	Syndrome	C	<b>Correct answer:</b> C — Disruption<br><br><b>Core idea (exam focus)</b><br>Disruptions are caused by external destructive forces.<br><br><b>Mechanism / reasoning</b><br>The structure initially forms normally and is then damaged.
Exposure to high-dose radiation during the 5th week of gestation most likely causes:	No effect on development	Minor functional defects only	Major structural malformations	Isolated growth retardation	Late-onset metabolic disease	C	<b>Correct answer:</b> C — Major structural malformations<br><br><b>Core idea (exam focus)</b><br>The 3rd–8th weeks correspond to organogenesis.<br><br><b>Mechanism / reasoning</b><br>Teratogen exposure during this period disrupts organ formation.
