Simple columnar ciliated epithelium	Serous secretory divisions of an exocrine glandular epithelium	Transversely striated cardiac muscle tissue	Endocrine glandular epithelium	Simple columnar resorptive epithelium	E	Brush border microvilli (up to ~300 per cell) are characteristic of simple columnar resorptive epithelium, especially in the intestine.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Elongated eosinophilic structural syncytia with regular transverse striations and round peripherally located nuclei indicate which tissue?	Transversely striated cardiac muscle tissue	Transversely striated skeletal muscle tissue	Simple columnar resorptive epithelium	Loose connective tissue	Endocrine glandular epithelium	B	Peripheral nuclei and prominent regular striations are classic for skeletal muscle fibers.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST

Endocrine glandular epithelium	Simple columnar ciliated epithelium	Serous secretory divisions of an exocrine glandular epithelium	Loose connective tissue	Lymphoid (reticular) connective tissue	C	Serous acini show pyramidal cells, apical eosinophilia (zymogen granules), and basal basophilia (RER).	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Weakly contacting fixed and migrating cells with abundant extracellular matrix rich in fine fibers describe which tissue?	Lymphoid (reticular) connective tissue	Endocrine glandular epithelium	Simple columnar resorptive epithelium	Loose connective tissue	Transversely striated skeletal muscle tissue	D	Loose connective tissue has diverse cells, abundant ground substance, and fine fibers.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Closely packed polyhedral cells with scarce extracellular matrix and no visible ducts or cavities describe which tissue?	Serous secretory divisions of an exocrine glandular epithelium	Loose connective tissue	Simple columnar ciliated epithelium	Lymphoid (reticular) connective tissue	Endocrine glandular epithelium	E	Endocrine glands lack ducts and consist of closely packed cells with minimal ECM.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which of the following does not belong to the formed elements of the blood?	fibrinogen	erythrocytes	reticulocytes	monocytes	platelets	A	Formed elements are cells and cell fragments; fibrinogen is a plasma protein.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
According to the shape of the secretory portion of the exocrine glands, they are classified as:	acinar	intraepithelial	mucous	serous	merocrine	A	Classification by shape refers to tubular, acinar (alveolar), or tubuloacinar glands.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
What type of cell junction is the hemidesmosome?	Cell-matrix	Cell-cell	Both cell-cell and cell-matrix	Neither cell-cell nor cell-matrix		A	Hemidesmosomes anchor epithelial cells to the basal lamina via integrins (cell–matrix junction).	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which cytoskeleton is associated with the adherent (adherens) junction?	Actin filament	Microtubule	Intermediate filament	All of them	None of them	A	Adherens junctions (zonula adherens) connect actin filaments of adjacent cells via cadherins and catenins.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
According to the shape of the secretory portion of the exocrine glands, they are classified as:	acinar	intraepithelial	mucous	serous	merocrine	A	Classification by shape refers to tubular, acinar (alveolar), or tubuloacinar glands. Other options describe location, type of secretion, or mode of secretion.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
