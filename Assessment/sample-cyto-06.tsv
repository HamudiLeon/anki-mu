Which cytoskeleton is associated with the focal adhesion:	Actin filament	Microtubule	Intermediate filament	All of them	None of them	A	Focal adhesions connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton via integrins and adaptor proteins such as talin and vinculin. They are involved in cell migration and mechanotransduction.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
All of the following statements regarding hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stain are true EXCEPT:	Hematoxylin is a basic stain, eosin is an acidic stain	Hematoxylin stains acidic structures blue	Basophilic structures are red in color	Eosin stains basic structures red	Eosin-stained structures are acidophilic	C	Basophilic structures bind hematoxylin and appear blue or purple. Red or pink staining is characteristic of eosinophilic (acidophilic) structures.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The approximate size of the platelets is:	2–4 µm	20–40 µm	20–40 nm	120–140 nm	30–50 µm	A	Platelets are small anucleate cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes. Their diameter is approximately 2–4 µm, smaller than erythrocytes.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Retrograde axonal transport is executed by the protein:	Dynein	Kinesin	Synaptophysin	Synaptotagmin	Myosin	A	Dynein mediates retrograde transport along microtubules toward the neuronal cell body. Kinesin mediates anterograde transport.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which of the following is typical for inhibitory synapses?	Both pre- and postsynaptic membranes are with a similar thickness	Asymmetrically thickened postsynaptic membrane	Asymmetrically thickened presynaptic membrane	Neurotransmitter action leads to depolarization	None of the listed	A	Inhibitory synapses (Gray type II) are symmetric, with similar thickness of pre- and postsynaptic membranes, and typically cause hyperpolarization.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which one of the following statements is NOT true regarding loose connective tissue?	The cells are arranged in isogenous groups	It builds lamina propria of mucous membranes	It is the site of first contact between bacteria and immune system	Most of the cell types are temporary migrating cells	It can increase substantially its volume during swelling	A	Isogenous cell groups are characteristic of cartilage. Loose connective tissue contains dispersed cells, abundant ground substance, and plays a role in immune defense and edema.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
When does implantation after fertilization end?	8–10 days	13–14 days	15–16 days	17–18 days	19–20 days	A	Implantation begins around day 6–7 and is completed by day 10 after fertilization, when the conceptus is fully embedded in the endometrium.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which of the statements regarding the types of spermatogonia is NOT true?	Type A – stem cell	Type A dark (Ad) – long-term reserve	Type A pale (Ap) – mitotically active	Type B – progenitor generating spermatocytes	Type C – stem cell generating Sertoli cells	E	Sertoli cells are somatic supporting cells derived embryologically and not from spermatogonia. Type C spermatogonia do not exist in standard classification.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which effect have prostaglandins of the semen?	They reduce viscosity of cervical mucus	Hydrolytic enzymes that invade endometrium	They stimulate peristaltic contractions of female tract	a. + c.	None of them	D	Seminal prostaglandins reduce cervical mucus viscosity and stimulate uterine and tubal smooth muscle contractions, facilitating sperm transport.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which embryonic layer is in direct contact with the parietal hypoblast until formation of extraembryonic mesoderm?	Cytotrophoblast	Syncytiotrophoblast	Epiblast	Amnion	None of the answers is true	A	Before formation of extraembryonic mesoderm, the parietal hypoblast (Heuser’s membrane) is directly apposed to the cytotrophoblast.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which of the following statement IS TRUE?	Chorionic villi form the fetal part of the placenta	Chorionic villi do not form the fetal part	Chorionic villi form the maternal part	Chorionic villi form the entire placenta	All statements are true	A	The placenta consists of a fetal part (chorion frondosum with chorionic villi) and a maternal part (decidua basalis).	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
In the beginning of the 3rd week the paraxial mesoderm differentiates into segments known as:	Somites (somitomeres)	Neuromeres	Mesonephroses	Metanephroses	Blood islands	A	The paraxial mesoderm segments into somites at the beginning of the third week, giving rise to sclerotome, myotome, and dermatome.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Which cytoskeleton is associated with the adherent (adherens) junction?	Actin filament	Microtubule	Intermediate filament	All of them	None of them	A	Adherens junctions (zonula adherens) connect actin filaments of adjacent cells via cadherins and catenins, providing mechanical linkage and signaling.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Match the tissue to its characteristic location: Dense irregular connective tissue =>	deep layer of the dermis	ligg. flava	spleen stroma	umbilical cord	skeleton	A	Dense irregular connective tissue is typical for the deep (reticular) layer of the dermis, where collagen bundles are arranged in multiple directions to resist stress.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Match the tissue to its characteristic location: Elastic connective tissue =>	ligg. flava	endocardium	spinal ganglia	deep layer of the dermis	umbilical cord	A	Elastic connective tissue is rich in elastic fibers and is classically found in elastic ligaments such as ligamenta flava (ligg. flava).	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Match the tissue to its characteristic location: Bone tissue =>	skeleton	spinal cord	spleen stroma	endocardium	deep layer of the dermis	A	Bone is mineralized connective tissue forming the skeleton.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Match the tissue to its characteristic location: Reticular connective tissue =>	spleen stroma	spinal ganglia	ligg. flava	umbilical cord	endocardium	A	Reticular connective tissue (type III collagen network) forms the supportive stroma of lymphoid organs such as the spleen.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
