Which of the following statements regarding the Z-discs is correct?	They are built of alpha-actinin	They are located in all types of muscle cells	They are composed of actin and myosin	They do not bind to myosin filaments	They can be located only at the edges of cardiomyocytes	A	Z-discs anchor thin (actin) filaments via alpha-actinin in striated muscle. Smooth muscle has dense bodies, not Z-discs.	Histology SAMPLETEST
Which of the following statements regarding the red muscle fibers is NOT correct?	they contract quickly	they have more myoglobin	they have more lipid droplets	the have less glycogen	they have more mitochondria	A	Red (type I) fibers are slow oxidative, rich in myoglobin and mitochondria, use lipids, relatively less glycogen.	Cytology SAMPLETEST
What is the average lifespan of lymphocytes?	from a few hours to a few decades	120 days	10-12 hours	9-12 days	1-8 days	A	Lymphocyte lifespan is highly variable, short-lived effectors to long-lived memory cells (years/decades).	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Which of the answers regarding the stratified epithelium is true?	None of the answers are true	It is only keratinized	It is only non-keratinized	It is is only corneal	It is only transitional (Henle)	A	Stratified epithelium includes keratinized, non-keratinized, and transitional (urothelium), so “only” statements are false.	Histology SAMPLETEST
How many lobules can we typically find in a neutrophilic granulocyte?	one - two	three - five	five- ten	ten - twelve	none of above	B	Mature neutrophils typically have a segmented nucleus with 3–5 lobes.	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Hyaline cartilage is present in the listed structures except for:	epiglottis	articular surfaces	C-shaped rings of the trachea	costal cartilages	nasal cartilages	A	Epiglottis is elastic cartilage. The others are classic hyaline cartilage locations.	Histology SAMPLETEST
Identify the tissue shown on the picture:	Complex tubuloacinar seromucous gland: serous, mucous and mixed secretory units.	Transverse section of smooth muscle cells in a small intestine.	Simple tubular mucous glands in large intestine.	Endocrine epithelium in the form of follicles – thyroid gland.		D	Follicles filled with eosinophilic colloid lined by simple cuboidal epithelium indicate thyroid gland.	Histology SAMPLETEST
Identify the depicted cell:	Basophilic granulocyte	Red blood cell	Monocyte	Goblet cell		C	Monocyte shows large size, kidney-shaped nucleus, abundant cytoplasm (TEM features).	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Identify the indicated cell:	Lymphocyte	Monocyte	Fibroblast	Megakaryocyte		B	Peripheral smear cell with kidney-shaped nucleus and abundant gray-blue cytoplasm is a monocyte.	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Caveolae are involved in all of the following EXCEPT:	ATP synthesis	Endocytosis	Vesicle formation	Intracellular traffic	Lipid rafts	A	Caveolae are membrane microdomains for endocytosis/trafficking/signaling; ATP synthesis is mitochondrial.	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Which of the following proteins is associated with plasmalemmal stability:	Spectrin	Ion channel	G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)	Cytosolic receptor	Tyrosine kinase receptor	A	Spectrin forms a submembranous cytoskeletal network stabilizing the plasma membrane (classic in RBCs).	Cytology SAMPLETEST
Which of the following cytoskeletal elements is important for the nucleus:	Intermediate filaments	Actin filaments	Microtubules	All are important	None are important	A	Nuclear lamina is composed of lamins (intermediate filaments), providing nuclear structural support.	Cytology SAMPLETEST
A genetic defect in the motor protein DYNEIN is linked to which of the following disorders?	Down syndrome	Kartagener syndrome	Niemann-Pick disease	Gaucher syndrome	None of the answers is correct	B	Dynein arm defect causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener: chronic infections, situs inversus, infertility).	Embryology SAMPLETEST
Match each tissue to the characteristic structure: (1) Covering epithelium (2) Cardiac muscle tissue (3) Nerve tissue (4) Glandular epithelium (5) Bone tissue	mesothelium	myocardium	synapse	islet of Langerhans	osteon	A	Correct mapping: covering epithelium→mesothelium, cardiac muscle→myocardium, nerve→synapse, glandular epithelium→islet of Langerhans, bone→osteon.	Histology SAMPLETEST
From the 3rd month, the hemopoiesis is:	Extravasal	Intravasal	There is no hemopoiesis yet	Extraembryonic	Pulmonary	A	From ~3rd month, fetal liver hematopoiesis is extravascular (cells form in tissue then enter blood).	Embryology SAMPLETEST
Which of the processes listed is NOT a stage of the fertilization?	Acrosomal reaction	Cortical reaction	Gametes' membranes fusion	Capacitation	Gastrulation	E	Gastrulation is week 3 germ-layer formation, not part of fertilization.	Embryology SAMPLETEST
The following structures are NOT derived from the endoderm:	Bones of pelvis	Muscles of anus	Heart and vessels	Nervous system	All answers are true	E	All listed structures are not endoderm-derived (bone/muscle/heart-vessels = mesoderm; nervous system = ectoderm).	Embryology SAMPLETEST
Which effect have prostaglandins of the semen?	They reduce viscosity of cervical mucus, making it easier for sperm to travel up cervical canal into uterus	They are hydrolytic enzymes that invade the endometrium	They stimulate peristaltic contractions of female reproductive tract	a. + c.	None of them	D	Semen prostaglandins facilitate sperm transport by thinning cervical mucus and stimulating uterine/tubal contractions.	Embryology SAMPLETEST
How does the female reproductive tract assist sperm migration?	by secretion of vaginal acid	by uterine contractions during orgasm and strands of cervical mucus	by a chemical secreted by the egg	A. + C.	B. + C.	E	Sperm transport is helped by uterine contractions + favorable cervical mucus, and chemotactic signaling near the oocyte (B + C).	Embryology SAMPLETEST
