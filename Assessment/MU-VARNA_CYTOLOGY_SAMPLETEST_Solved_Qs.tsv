Which of the following cytoskeletal elements is important for the nucleus:	Intermediate filaments	Actin filaments	Microtubules	All are important	None are important	A	"<div><strong>Correct:</strong> A</div>
<div><strong>Core idea (exam focus):</strong> Structural support of the nucleus is provided by the nuclear lamina.</div>
<div><strong>Mechanism / reasoning:</strong> Nuclear lamina lines the inner nuclear membrane and is built from lamins, which are intermediate filaments. This directly maintains nuclear shape and mechanical stability.</div>
<div><strong>Why the other options are not:</strong><ul><li>B: Actin mainly supports cell cortex, motility, adhesion; not the nuclear lamina.</li><li>C: Microtubules organize mitotic spindle and intracellular transport; not a structural nuclear scaffold.</li><li>D: Tempting but incorrect, only intermediate filaments are the direct nuclear support element here.</li><li>E: False, lamins are essential for nuclear integrity.</li></ul></div>
<div><strong>Exam gold (high-yield):</strong> Nucleus → nuclear lamina → lamins → intermediate filaments.</div>
<div><strong>Active recall:</strong> Name the transport system that uses Ran-GTP: importins/exportins (through nuclear pore complexes).</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The structures depicted by arrows are cisterns of:	Nucleus	Smooth endoplasmic reticulum	Mitochondrion	Rough endoplasmic reticulum		D	"<div><strong>Correct:</strong> D</div>
<div><strong>Core idea (exam focus):</strong> RER is recognized on TEM by stacked flattened cisternae studded with ribosomes.</div>
<div><strong>Mechanism / reasoning:</strong> The arrows point to parallel flattened membranes with dense dots on the cytosolic surface (ribosomes). That combination is classic rough ER.</div>
<div><strong>Why the other options are not:</strong><ul><li>A: Nucleus shows chromatin, nuclear envelope, nucleolus, not stacked ribosome-studded cisternae.</li><li>B: SER is tubular and lacks ribosomes.</li><li>C: Mitochondria have double membrane and cristae, not continuous cisternae.</li></ul></div>

<div><strong>Active recall:</strong> If the membranes were smooth and tubular (no dots), which organelle would you choose?</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Amino-oxidase and catalase are characteristic enzymes for:	Smooth endoplasmic reticulum	Golgi complex	Lysosomes	Peroxisomes	Mitochondria	D	"<div><strong>Correct:</strong> D</div>
<div><strong>Core idea (exam focus):</strong> Peroxisomes are defined by oxidative enzymes handling H₂O₂.</div>
<div><strong>Mechanism / reasoning:</strong> Amino-oxidases generate H₂O₂ during oxidation, catalase decomposes H₂O₂ to H₂O + O₂. This oxidase–catalase pairing is diagnostic for peroxisomes.</div>
<div><strong>Why the other options are not:</strong><ul><li>A: SER detox uses CYP450; catalase is not the hallmark.</li><li>B: Golgi modifies and sorts proteins; no oxidase/catalase signature.</li><li>C: Lysosomes contain acid hydrolases, not oxidases/catalase.</li><li>E: Mitochondria are for oxidative phosphorylation; catalase is not characteristic.</li></ul></div>
<div><strong>Exam gold (high-yield):</strong> H₂O₂ metabolism = peroxisome (oxidases make it, catalase breaks it).</div>
<div><strong>Active recall:</strong> What toxic molecule accumulates first when catalase is deficient?</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The transport from/to the nucleus takes place via:	Nuclear pore complexes	Inner nuclear membrane	Outer nuclear membrane	Nuclear lamina		A	"<div><strong>Correct:</strong> A</div>
<div><strong>Core idea (exam focus):</strong> Regulated nucleus–cytoplasm exchange occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs).</div>
<div><strong>Mechanism / reasoning:</strong> NPCs are protein channels spanning the nuclear envelope. Small molecules diffuse, and larger cargos use signal-dependent transport (NLS/NES via importins/exportins with Ran-GTP).</div>
<div><strong>Why the other options are not:</strong><ul><li>B: Inner nuclear membrane is a barrier and structural platform, not the transport route.</li><li>C: Outer nuclear membrane is continuous with RER but still not a route into nucleus.</li><li>D: Nuclear lamina provides structural support, not transport.</li></ul></div>
<div><strong>Exam gold (high-yield):</strong> Transport = pores, not membranes.</div>
