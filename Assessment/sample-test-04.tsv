Which type of cartilage tissue forms the template for the endochondral bone formation?	Hyaline	Elastic	Fibrocartilage	Compact	Spongy	A	Endochondral ossification proceeds by replacement of a hyaline cartilage model.	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The process of metaplasia is:	transformation from one subtype to another subtype of the same type of basic tissue	uncontrolled cellular proliferation	exocrine secretion of substances	programmed cell death	endocrine secretion of substances	A	Metaplasia is a reversible adaptive change replacing one differentiated cell type with another of the same tissue lineage.
