Membrane proteins that are not localized in the plasma membrane:	Integrins	Cadherins	Histone molecules	Ion channels	Glycoprotein receptors	C	<div><strong>Correct: C. Histone molecules</strong></div><div>Histones are nuclear proteins associated with chromatin, not plasma membrane proteins.</div>	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY Membranes
All are true EXCEPT - organelles involved in the secretory pathway are:	Rough endoplasmic reticulum	Golgi apparatus	Secretory vesicles	Lysosomes	Microtubules	E	<div><strong>Correct: E. Microtubules</strong></div><div>Secretory pathway organelles: RER → Golgi → vesicles → membrane/lysosomes. Microtubules support transport but are not secretory organelles.</div>	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY SecretoryPathway
How many are the centrioles during the G2 phase of the cell cycle?	2	3	4	6	8	C	<div><strong>Correct: C. 4</strong></div><div>By G2, the centrosome has duplicated: two centrosomes, each with a pair of centrioles → total <strong>4 centrioles</strong>.</div>	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY CellCycle
Which disassembly of nuclear envelope in mitosis occurs during:	Prophase	Prometaphase	Metaphase	Anaphase	Telophase	B	<div><strong>Correct: B. Prometaphase</strong></div><div>Nuclear envelope breakdown occurs in <strong>prometaphase</strong>, allowing spindle microtubules to attach to kinetochores.</div>	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY Mitosis
The second week of development the embryoblast differentiates into:	One layer	Two layers	Three layers	Four layers	Five layers	B	<div><strong>Correct: B. Two layers</strong></div><div>Week 2: embryoblast forms the <strong>bilaminar disc</strong> (epiblast + hypoblast).</div>	GENQUESTION EMBRYOLOGY Week2
Histiocytes is an alternative name for:	Fibroblasts	Macrophages	Plasma cells	Neutrophils	Endothelial cells	B	<div><strong>Correct: B. Macrophages</strong></div><div>Histiocytes are tissue-resident macrophages in connective tissue.</div>	GENQUESTION HISTOLOGY ConnectiveTissue
