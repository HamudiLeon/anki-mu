Question	OptionA	OptionB	OptionC	OptionD	OptionE	Correct	Explanation	Tags
The protein clathrin is involved in all of the following EXCEPT:	Formation of coated vesicles	Endocytosis at the plasma membrane	Sorting of proteins in the Golgi apparatus	Receptor-mediated endocytosis	Protein synthesis	E	"<div><strong>Correct: E. Protein synthesis</strong></div>
<div><strong>Why?</strong> <em>Clathrin</em> forms the protein “coat” of <strong>clathrin-coated pits/vesicles</strong>, enabling <strong>membrane budding</strong> and cargo selection during <strong>endocytosis</strong> and <strong>Golgi–endosome trafficking</strong>.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A, B, D</strong>: classic clathrin functions in <strong>vesicle formation</strong> and <strong>receptor-mediated endocytosis</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>C</strong>: clathrin participates in trafficking from the <strong>trans-Golgi network</strong> to endosomes.</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> is wrong because <strong>protein synthesis</strong> occurs on <strong>ribosomes</strong> (free or RER-bound), not via clathrin.</li>

The mesoderm is generated by:	Hypoblast	Epiblast	Primitive endoderm	Trophoblast	Amnion	B	"<div><strong>Correct: B. Epiblast</strong></div>
<div><strong>Mechanism:</strong> During <strong>gastrulation</strong>, epiblast cells migrate through the <strong>primitive streak</strong>:</div>
<ul>
  <li>First wave replaces hypoblast → <strong>definitive endoderm</strong></li>
  <li>Next wave spreads between layers → <strong>intraembryonic mesoderm</strong></li>
  <li>Remaining epiblast → <strong>ectoderm</strong></li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Exam tip:</strong> <strong>All three germ layers derive from epiblast.</strong></div>"	GENQUESTION EMBRYOLOGY
From which germ layer originates the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary)?	Neural crest	Neuroectoderm	Surface ectoderm	Mesoderm	Endoderm	C	"<div><strong>Correct: C. Surface ectoderm</strong></div>
<div>The <strong>adenohypophysis</strong> develops from <strong>Rathke’s pouch</strong>, an upward outgrowth of the <strong>oral ectoderm</strong> (surface ectoderm).</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)</strong> is from <strong>neuroectoderm</strong> (diencephalon) — common distractor.</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION EMBRYOLOGY
Which cells are generated by the secondary spermatocytes?	Spermatogonia	Sertoli cells	Early spermatids	Spermatozoa	Primary spermatocytes	C	"<div><strong>Correct: C. Early spermatids</strong></div>
<div><strong>Sequence:</strong> Primary spermatocyte (2n) → <strong>Meiosis I</strong> → secondary spermatocyte (n) → <strong>Meiosis II</strong> → <strong>spermatids (n)</strong>.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spermatozoa</strong> form later by <strong>spermiogenesis</strong> (maturation of spermatids), not directly from secondary spermatocytes.</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION HISTOLOGY
Which of the following phases of the menstrual cycle is under progesterone control?	Menstrual phase	Follicular phase	Proliferative phase	Secretory phase	Ovulatory phase	D	"<div><strong>Correct: D. Secretory phase</strong></div>
<div><strong>Progesterone</strong> from the <strong>corpus luteum</strong> converts the estrogen-primed endometrium into a <strong>secretory</strong>, implantation-ready lining.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proliferative/Follicular</strong> phase is mainly <strong>estrogen-driven</strong>.</li>
  <li>Progesterone withdrawal → endometrial shedding → <strong>menstruation</strong>.</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION HISTOLOGY
A sperm sample is considered to have normal morphology when:	At least 4% of sperm are normal	At least 10% of sperm are normal	At least 12% of sperm are normal	If 14% or more of the observed sperm are normal	If all sperm are morphologically identical	D	"<div><strong>Correct: D. If 14% or more of the observed sperm are normal</strong></div>
<div>Many exam keys (including older WHO-style teaching) use <strong>≥14% normal forms</strong> as the threshold for “normal morphology.”</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Some modern “strict” criteria use lower cutoffs, but follow the <strong>exam’s stated key</strong>.</div>"	GENQUESTION HISTOLOGY
What is the shape of the nucleus of a typical cardiomyocyte?	Round	Flattened	Irregular	Oval	Segmented	D	"<div><strong>Correct: D. Oval</strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Typical cardiomyocyte: <strong>1 central oval nucleus</strong> (sometimes 2).</li>
  <li><strong>Skeletal muscle</strong>: many peripheral nuclei.</li>
  <li><strong>Neutrophils</strong>: segmented nuclei (classic distractor).</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION HISTOLOGY Cytology
Match the germ layers and their respective tissue derivatives:	Paraxial mesoderm ⇒ Epidermis	Intermediate mesoderm ⇒ Gonads	Endoderm ⇒ Skeletal muscle	Ectoderm ⇒ Kidneys	Neural crest ⇒ Smooth muscle	B	"<div><strong>Correct: B. Intermediate mesoderm ⇒ Gonads</strong></div>
<div><strong>Intermediate mesoderm</strong> forms the <strong>urogenital ridge</strong> → kidneys + gonads and their ducts.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Paraxial mesoderm</strong> → somites → skeletal muscle, vertebrae, dermis (not epidermis).</li>
  <li><strong>Ectoderm</strong> → epidermis + nervous system (not kidneys).</li>
  <li><strong>Endoderm</strong> → epithelial lining of gut/respiratory tract (not skeletal muscle).</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION EMBRYOLOGY
All of the following answers are true EXCEPT: Microtubules can be localized:	In centrosomes	In cilia	In flagella	In the mitotic spindle	In microvilli	E	"<div><strong>Correct: E. In microvilli</strong></div>
<div><strong>Microvilli</strong> are supported by <strong>actin filaments</strong> (microfilaments), not microtubules.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cilia/flagella</strong>: microtubule axoneme (9+2).</li>
  <li><strong>Centrosome/mitotic spindle</strong>: microtubule organizing and spindle formation.</li>
</ul>"	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY Cytoskeleton
What type of cell junction is the focal adhesion?	Cell–cell anchoring junction	Occluding junction	Communicating junction	Cell–matrix junction	Specialized tight junction	D	"<div><strong>Correct: D. Cell–matrix junction</strong></div>
<div><strong>Focal adhesions</strong> link <strong>actin filaments</strong> inside the cell to the <strong>extracellular matrix</strong> via <strong>integrins</strong> and adaptor proteins (e.g., talin, vinculin).</div>
<div><strong>Contrast:</strong> <strong>Desmosomes</strong> are cell–cell junctions linked to <strong>intermediate filaments</strong>.</div>"	GENQUESTION CYTOLOGY Cytoskeleton
