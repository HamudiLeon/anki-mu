All of the following answers are true EXCEPT: Microtubules can be localized:	To the cytosol – free	In centrosomes	In microvilli	In cilia	In flagella	C	"<div><strong>Correct: C</strong></div>
<div><strong>Key idea:</strong> <em>Microvilli are actin-based</em>, not microtubule-based.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Microvilli</strong>: core bundle of <strong>actin filaments</strong> anchored in the <strong>terminal web</strong> (increase surface area).</li>
  <li><strong>Cilia/flagella</strong>: axoneme built from <strong>microtubules</strong> (classically 9+2; primary cilium 9+0).</li>
  <li><strong>Centrosome</strong>: main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Exam trap:</strong> confuse <strong>microvilli (actin)</strong> with <strong>cilia (microtubules)</strong>.</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
Identify the presented structure:	Terminal cistern	Polysome	Nuclear pore complex	Nucleolus	None of the above	C	"<div><strong>Correct: C</strong></div>
<div><strong>Why:</strong> The image shows a <strong>double nuclear membrane</strong> interrupted by a structured channel and a ring/rosette appearance in tangential view—classic for the <strong>nuclear pore complex (NPC)</strong>.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>NPC function:</strong> selective transport (proteins into nucleus; mRNA/ribosomal subunits out).</li>
  <li><strong>Not nucleolus:</strong> nucleolus is dense but <em>not</em> a membrane-spanning pore.</li>
  <li><strong>Not polysome:</strong> polysomes are cytosolic ribosome clusters without nuclear envelope rings.</li>

Identify the shown tissue:	Elastic cartilage	Regular dense (collagen) connective tissue	Hyaline cartilage	Nervous tissue	None of the above	A	"<div><strong>Correct: A</strong></div>
<div><strong>Why:</strong> Cartilage with many <strong>chondrocytes in lacunae</strong> plus a conspicuous network of <strong>elastic fibers</strong> in the matrix.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Elastic cartilage:</strong> type II collagen + <strong>elastic fibers</strong> (fibers visible as dark branching network).</li>
  <li><strong>Hyaline cartilage:</strong> “glassy” matrix; fibers usually not visible on routine stains.</li>
  <li><strong>Dense regular CT:</strong> parallel collagen bundles, no lacunae.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Common sites:</strong> epiglottis, auricle (pinna), auditory tube.</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The process of compaction of the pre-embryo leads to a formation of outer and inner cell mass, which differ in their intercellular junctions as follows:	Outer cell mass – tight junctions, inner cell mass – gap junctions	Outer cell mass – adherent junctions, inner cell mass – desmosomes	Outer cell mass – gap junctions, inner cell mass – tight junctions	Outer cell mass – desmosomes, inner cell mass – adherent junctions	Outer cell mass – hemidesmosomes, inner cell mass – desmosomes	A	"<div><strong>Correct: A</strong></div>
<div><strong>Core concept:</strong> During <strong>compaction</strong> (around the 8-cell stage), the <strong>outer cells</strong> become epithelial-like and must form a seal to allow <strong>blastocoel</strong> formation.</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Outer cell mass (trophoblast lineage):</strong> enriched in <strong>tight junctions</strong> → barrier to prevent fluid leakage.</li>
  <li><strong>Inner cell mass (embryoblast):</strong> enriched in <strong>gap junctions</strong> → cell-cell communication and coordination of fate.</li>
  <li><strong>Hemidesmosomes:</strong> anchor cells to basal lamina—<em>not</em> the key junction here.</li>
</ul>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
The amniotic and yolk sac cavities are temporarily connected by:	The neurenteric canal	Allantois	Trophoblast	Cytotrophoblast	None of the listed	A	"<div><strong>Correct: A</strong></div>
<div><strong>Why:</strong> During <strong>gastrulation</strong>, a transient communication can exist between <strong>amniotic cavity</strong> and <strong>yolk sac</strong> via the <strong>neurenteric canal</strong> (through the primitive pit).</div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Allantois:</strong> diverticulum from yolk sac involved in early bladder/umbilical region—not a direct amnion–yolk sac connector.</li>
  <li><strong>Trophoblast/cytotrophoblast:</strong> placental tissues, not cavity connectors.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Exam anchor:</strong> “temporary connection amnion ↔ yolk sac” → <strong>neurenteric canal</strong>.</div>"	CYTOLOGY SAMPLETEST
