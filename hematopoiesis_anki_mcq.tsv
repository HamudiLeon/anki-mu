Question	OptionA	OptionB	OptionC	OptionD	Correct	Explanation
The first blood cells originate from:	Liver sinusoids	Cells around the yolk sac / yolk sac	Bone marrow stroma	Spleen pulp	B	Hematopoiesis begins in the extraembryonic mesoderm of the yolk sac (blood islands) around the 3rd week of development.
From the 3rd month, the hemopoiesis is:	Intravasal	Extravasal	Intralymphatic	Intranodal	B	Early yolk sac hematopoiesis is largely intravasal, but from the hepatic phase (starting month 3) onwards, blood cell formation occurs outside the vessels (extravasal) in the stroma of organs like the liver and bone marrow.
From which cells do reticulocytes originate during erythrocytopoiesis?	Proerythroblast	Polychromatophilic erythroblast	Orthochromatophilic erythroblast (Normoblast)	Basophilic erythroblast	C	The orthochromatophilic erythroblast (normoblast) expels its nucleus to become a reticulocyte.
A characteristic feature of erythropoiesis is:	Increase in nuclear size	Accumulation of specific granules	Disappearance of almost all organelles	Increase in rough endoplasmic reticulum	C	As erythrocytes mature to maximize space for hemoglobin, they lose their nucleus and almost all organelles (mitochondria, ribosomes, etc.).
Which hormone stimulated the formation of hemoglobin?	Thrombopoietin	Erythropoietin	Somatotropin	Insulin	B	Erythropoietin (EPO), produced mainly by the kidneys, is the primary regulator of red blood cell and hemoglobin production.
The average lifetime of erythrocytes in the circulatory system is:	10 days	60 days	120 days	200 days	C	After approximately 120 days, senescent RBCs are removed from circulation by macrophages in the spleen and liver.
The average diameter of an erythrocyte is:	2.5 μm	7.5 μm	12.5 μm	15.0 μm	B	The biconcave disc of a mature erythrocyte typically measures 7.5 μm in diameter.
As a source of energy erythrocytes use:	Aerobic respiration in mitochondria	Anaerobic glycolysis in the cytoplasm	Beta-oxidation of fatty acids	Protein degradation	B	Because mature RBCs lack mitochondria, they must rely solely on anaerobic glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) for ATP.
Which of the blood cells do NOT have a nucleus?	Monocytes	Mature red blood cells	Lymphocytes	Neutrophils	B	Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei during maturation to increase flexibility and oxygen-carrying capacity.
In granulocytopoiesis, which cell type is the next developmental stage after “myeloblast” stage?	Myelocyte	Metamyelocyte	Promyelocyte	Band cell	C	The sequence is: Myeloblast → Promyelocyte → Myelocyte → Metamyelocyte → Band cell → Mature Granulocyte.
Which of the listed cell types is at the earliest stage of granulocytopoiesis?	Myelocyte	Hemocytoblast	Promyelocyte	Metamyelocyte	B	The hemocytoblast is the pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell from which all blood lineages derive.
How many types of myelocytes are recognized?	Two (acidophilic and basophilic)	Three (neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic)	One (undifferentiated)	Four (including monocytic)	B	Myelocytes are the stage where specific (secondary) granules first appear, allowing us to distinguish the three granulocytic lines.
How many lobules can we typically find in a neutrophilic granulocyte?	One (S-shaped)	Two (bilobed)	Three–five	Seven–nine	C	Normal mature neutrophils have 3 to 5 nuclear lobes. More than 5 indicates hypersegmentation.
In which combination are the stages of monocytopoiesis ordered correctly?	Monoblast → Monocyte → Promonocyte	Promonocyte → Monoblast → Monocyte	Monoblast → Promonocyte → Monocyte	Monocyte → Promonocyte → Macrophage	C	Monocytes develop from monoblasts through the intermediate promonocyte stage before entering the blood.
Which of the following cells participates in the process of monocytopoiesis?	Promyelocyte	Promonocyte	Normoblast	Megakaryoblast	B	The promonocyte is the immediate precursor to the mature monocyte.
What is the normal percentage of the monocytes out of circulating leukocytes?	0–1%	2–4%	5–8%	20–30%	C	Monocytes normally account for roughly 3–8% (MU Varna uses 5–8%) of the total white blood cell count.
Macrophages in tissues are derived from which blood cells?	Lymphocytes	Monocyte	Basophils	Platelets	B	Monocytes circulate in the blood for about 12-100 hours before migrating into tissues to differentiate into macrophages.
Thromboprotein is a hormone important for:	Erythropoiesis	Leukopoiesis	Thrombocytopoiesis	Granulocytopoiesis	C	Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary hormone regulating the production of platelets by megakaryocytes.
Alpha-, gamma-, delta-granules are specific for:	Erythrocytes	Monocytes	Thrombocytes	Eosinophils	C	Platelets (thrombocytes) contain these specific granules which house clotting factors, calcium, and ADP.
Which structure is highly specific for platelets?	Large central nucleus, 15 μm, spherical	No nucleus, ~2–3 μm, irregular	Bilobed nucleus, 10 μm, contains histamine	Multinucleated, 100 μm, regular shape	B	Platelets are small, anucleated cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes.
Which statement is NOT TRUE about platelets:	They are fragments of megakaryocytes	They play a role in blood clotting	They contain hemoglobin	They contain a hyalomere and granulomere	C	Hemoglobin is specific to erythrocytes; platelets contain no hemoglobin.
Which is correct for platelets diameter?	0.5–1 μm	2–4 μm	7–8 μm	10–12 μm	B	Platelets are very small, typically ranging between 2 and 4 μm in diameter.
The blood is made up of two main components:	Water (90%) and Proteins (10%)	Plasma (55%) and RBC (44%)	Serum (50%) and Leukocytes (50%)	Hemoglobin and Iron	B	Plasma constitutes about 55% of blood volume, while formed elements (mostly RBCs) make up the rest.
What is the normal number of leukocytes in 1 μl blood?	4.5–5.0 million	150,000–400,000	6,000–10,000	1,000–2,000	C	Normal leukocyte counts range from 4,000 to 11,000/μl; MU Varna tests use 6,000–10,000/μl.
Which does NOT belong to the formed elements of blood?	Erythrocytes	Platelets	Fibrinogen	Leukocytes	C	Fibrinogen is a plasma protein, not a 'formed element' (cell or cell fragment).
Normal blood volume in healthy adults is:	2–3 liter	5–6 liter	8–10 liter	12–15 liter	B	Average adult blood volume is approximately 5 to 6 liters.
